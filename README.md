minimal object-oriented language with integrated semantic state
access.  The interpreter can be used to examine the state with SPARQL,
SHACL and OWL queries.


This branch in particular contains the case study for modeling geological processes, 
to run the case study of the paper, run the following command (on a Linux machine)
```
./execute_case.sh
