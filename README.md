# Semantic Micro Object Language

This repository contains an interactive interpreter for **SMOL**, a
minimal object-oriented language with integrated semantic state
access.  The interpreter can be used to examine the state with SPARQL,
SHACL and OWL queries.


This branch in particular contains the case study for modeling geological processes.

To run the experiment contained in the article _"Semantically Triggered Qualitative Simulation of a Geological Process"_, run the following commands (tested on a Linux machine)
```
chmod +x ./execute_case.sh
./execute_case.sh
```

For a general description and tutorial to SMOL, we refer to [its webpage](www.smolang.org).
